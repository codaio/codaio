In this channel I will periodically talk about my years of experience in building a personal knowledge base. I plan to write about Zettelkasten, Obsidian, Org-mode. I will tell about what works for me (and others) and what does not (and why).

I will describe my work on orgever project - publish-first framework for organizing eternal knowledge base.

Some other topics will come up, such as self-management, focus, and application of systematic approach to life practices.

Come discuss!
